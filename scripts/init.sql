-- Initial database setup script
-- This runs when the PostgreSQL container starts for the first time

-- Create database if it doesn't exist (handled by environment variables)
-- The database is created by POSTGRES_DB environment variable

-- Set up any initial data or configurations here if needed
-- For now, we'll let SQLAlchemy handle table creation
